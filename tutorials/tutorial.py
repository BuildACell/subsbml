from subsbml import * 

# Create a system. Example - A cell system which acts as a container for 
# all the different subsystems. Here, cell is an object of the System class
cell = System('cell')

# The ListOfSharedResources is a list to name all the species that are shared
# in the cell system. Usually, we would have something as follows - 
# system.ListOfSharedResources = ['RNAP','Ribo','ATP']

# For our simple example of DP and IFFL subsystems, we use the following for a working demo
cell.ListOfSharedResources = ['inP','X:P']


# Now, create a subsystem inside the cell as follows - 
# Usage self.createSubsystem(filename, string)
# The string can be anything and is used to name the components of the subsystem
# An object of the Subsystem classs is returned 
# and a list of subsystems being added to the cell is recorded. Here, DP1.
DP1 = cell.createSubsystem('models/DP.xml','DP1')

# There are other optional steps -

# (Optional) Give a new string to suffix all components of the model. 
# By default, the names are suffixed by the keyword given to make the Subsystem object.
# Usage -  DP1_doc = DP1.suffixAllElementIds('DPx')


# (Optional) Rename IDs of any species/compartments or any other component of the 
# subsystem as desired. This may be a helpful utility function to make sure 
# that the shared resources (and other interacting elements) have same IDs or names (as desired)
# To rename ID of a component and to propagate the changes everywhere in the model - 
# Usage - subsystem_object.renameSId(old_id, new_id) (where the ids are string type)
# DP1.renameSId('inp_DP1','inp_DP1_new')

# (Optional) Rename the names of any species -
# Usage - subsystem_object.renameSName(old_name, new_name)
# DP1.renameSName('inP', 'input')
# renames 'inp' named species to 'input'

# (Optional) Give a compartment to put the subsystem in. 
# By default, the subsystem is kept in the "cell" compartment (the System object used)
# Which compartment do you want to put the subsystem in? Usage --
# newCompartment = ['cell_new']
# DP1.setSubsystemCompartments(newCompartment)

# (Optional) Write the Subsystem model created to output an SBML file
# DP1_doc = DP1.getSBMLDocument()
# writeSBML(DP1_doc,'models/DP1.xml')

# Using the steps shown above, we create two other subsystems - DP2 and IFFL

DP2 = cell.createSubsystem('models/DP.xml','DP2')
# newCompartment = ['cell_new']
# DP2.setSubsystemCompartments(newCompartment)
# writeSBML(DP2.getSBMLDocument(),'models/DP2.xml')

# Creating an Incoherent Feedforward Loop subsystem 
IFFL = cell.createSubsystem('models/IFFL.xml','IFFL')

# Other methods available - 
# cell.getSystemName()
# cell.setSystemName('cell2')
# cell.getListOfSubsystems()
# cell.getListOfSharedResources()
# cell.appendSharedResources(['A','B'])
# cell.removeSharedResource('A')

# newCompartment = ['cell_new']
# IFFL.setSubsystemCompartments(newCompartment)
# IFFL_doc = IFFL.getSBMLDocument()
# writeSBML(IFFL_doc,'models/IFFL.xml')

# Set the list of shared resources to the cell using its member function. Example 1-A
# Usage - system_obj.setSharedResources(), returns a new SBMLDocument object of the Subsystem
# object (inside the same system object) which has the resources sharing modeled.
print('Creating shared model and writing to SBML file')
shared_model = cell.setSharedResources('virtual')

# (Optional) Write the shared document model to SBML file
libsbml.writeSBML(shared_model,'models/DP_IFFL_shared.xml')

# The combineSubsystems member function implements Example 1-B.
# Usage - subsystem_object.combineSubsystems(ListOfSubsystems, combineAllWithSameNames)
# The subsystem_object is a new subsystem object which calls combineSubsystems
# As a result, the subsystem_object contains the combined model.

# The second argument is Boolean which is True if all species with same 
# names need to be merged and False otherwise. 

print('Creating combined model and writing it to SBML file')
combined_subsystem = createNewSubsystem()
combined_model = combined_subsystem.combineSubsystems([DP1, DP2, IFFL], 'volume', True)

# (Optional) Write the combined document model to SBML file
libsbml.writeSBML(combined_model,'models/DP_IFFL_combined.xml')

# Now, for Example 1-C, the user needs to specify 
# the map of the interaction modeling that is desired. This map uses species names.
# User specifies how the systems interact by defining the following map
# Usage - connection_logic is a dictionary specifying the map. 
# Two different species can be combined by defining the following map
connection_logic = {}
connection_logic['X:P:P'] = 'pA_IFFL'
DP2.renameSName('X:P:P','X:P:P_DP2')
connection_logic['X:P:P_DP2'] = 'pB_IFFL'


# Call connectInteraction function for the final subsystem object
# to connect various subsystems.
# Usage - subsystem_object.self.connectSubsystems(ListOfSubsystems, connectionMap, mode, combineAllWithSameNames, amount)
print('Creating connected model and writing  to SBML file')
connected_subsystem = createNewSubsystem()
connected_subsystem.connectSubsystems([DP1, DP2, IFFL], connection_logic, 'virtual', True, 'constant', [37,37])

# (Optional Utility Function) Set a new amount of a Species
# Usage - setSpeciesAmount(self, species, amount)
# Looks for the species and sets its amount
connected_subsystem.setSpeciesAmount('inp_IFFL',0)

# Write the connected document returned above to a SBML file
libsbml.writeSBML(connected_subsystem.getSBMLDocument(),'models/DP_IFFL_connected.xml')

print('Tutorial successfully finished. Shared/combined/connected SBML models have been created and written to file. Use bioscrape options to simulate.')

### Simulate using bioscrape (Optional - Uncomment to use the following)
# Usage - plotSbmlWithBioscrape(filename, initialTime, timepoints, 
# ListOfSpeciesToPlot, xLabel, yLabel, xAxisSize, yAxisSize)

timepoints = np.linspace(0,50,1000)
# plotSbmlWithBioscrape('models/DP_IFFL_shared.xml',0,
plotSbmlWithBioscrape('models/DP_IFFL_combined.xml',0,
# plotSbmlWithBioscrape('models/DP_IFFL_connected.xml',0,
timepoints,['inP','pA_IFFL','pB_IFFL','out_IFFL'],'','Time',
# timepoints,['inP','X:P:P','X:P:P_DP2','out_IFFL'],'Time',
