## Sub-SBML
Sub-SBML is a Python based toolbox to create, edit, combine, and model interactions among multiple Systems Biology Markup Language [(SBML)](http://sbml.org) models. 
Sub-SBML works with a “subsystem” architecture of modeling where a single SBML model can be contained within a subsystem. 
Three major functionalities are developed in Sub-SBML that take advantage of this subsystem framework of modeling –  
creating subsystems, combining multiple subsystems, and modeling interactions such as transport of molecules and input-output relationships among multiple subsystems.
