Sub-SBML works with a “subsystem” architecture of modeling where a single SBML model can be contained within a subsystem. 
Three major functionalities are developed in Sub-SBML that take advantage of this subsystem framework of modeling –  
creating subsystems, combining multiple subsystems, and modeling interactions such as transport of molecules and input-output relationships among multiple subsystems.
