    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a step by step guide to create new biomolecular circuit models in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). The txtlsim-python toolbox uses the libSBML Python API. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods in the txtlsim-python toolbox to create new SBML models help the user to create models using simple commands rather than the tedious approach when using libSBML classes directly. New users might also find using the methods described below to create new SBML models easier to work with compared to the libSBML API. The SimpleModel and NewReaction classes consist of the most important member functions helpful in creating new models. These are available in the txtlsim-python/BioSIMI-Python/modules/ directory. The object structure of the software design provides for easily using original libSBML methods along with the methods provided in this toolbox.\n",

    "## Model - Double Phosphorylation\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate the modeling of a double phosphorylation system. Double phosphorylation is one of the main building blocks of the MAPK cascade, which represents a recurrent structural motif in several signaling pathways. In this model, we assume that an input species, _inP_ , of the double phosphorylation circuit catalyzes phosphorylation of a species _X_ into single-phosphorylated species _X:P_ and phosphorylation of _X:P_ into double-phosphorylated species _X:P:P_. Species are\n",
    "dephosphorylated by an enzyme _E_.\n",

    "Create a System to which would act as a compartment to hold the model that we are going to create using the following command. \n",
    "Usage - `system_obj = System('system_name') `\n",
    "The above call returns the System object created with the given system_name as a string. \n",

The createNewSubsystem is a member function of System class which creates an empty SBMLDocument of given level and version as arguments in the createNewSubsystem call. Usage - `subsystem_object = system_object.createNewSubsystem(level, version)`\n",

    "Next, we create a SBML model for the Subsystem object created. To create a new model, the member function of Subsystem class can be used as `self.createNewModel(model_id, model_time_units, model_extent_units, model_substance_units)`. This function call returns a libSBML Model object, which can be used to create a SimpleModel class object or may be used for calls to libSBML Model class member functions. \n",

    "As mentioned earlier, an important feature of the txtlsim-python toolbox is that its customizabile with libSBML member functions. Most function calls and methods in the different classes defined in the toolbox, return objects of the libSBML Python API so that all the methods defined for libSBML can be easily used for any functionality that is not already provided by txtlsim-python.\n",

    "The most commonly used features and important methods are already covered in the txtlsim-python toolbox's Classes (as described later in this notebook), so you would not have to write tedious code using libSBML member functions. However, if there's some feature which is not covered here or does not work as desired, the txtlsim-python classes' member functions return libSBML objects and hence they may be used for such features.

    "### Creating all reactions \n",
    "\n",
    "To model reactions, the createNewReaction method accepts reaction strings directly. A reaction string uses `-->` to represent the arrow of an irreversible reaction and a `<->` to represent the arrow of a reversible reaction. (Note that both arrows are of the same length and effectively the first hyphen '-' is replaced by a '<' to get the arrow for reversible reaction).  \n",
    "Depending on the arrow used, the reaction's reversible attribute is set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples - \n",
    "\n",
    "* A irreversible reaction string `RNAP + SIGX --> RNAP:SIGX`.\n",
    "* A reversible reaction string `3 RNAP + 2SIGX <-> Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that stoichiometries are picked up from the reaction string too. The whitespaces do not matter and a '+' should be used to separate reactants. All species in the reaction string should use the names of the species as created before. Ensure that there multiple species of the same name do not exist in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The createNewReaction method accepts a rate formula as a string directly which creates the reaction kinetic law. The rate formmula should use the identifiers for the species and parameters that it refers. This is important to consider because while creating parameters and species, only names were given and the ids were generated according to the names. In the usual case, the id generated will be the same as the name given for the species or the parameters. However, special characters which are not allowed in SBML identifier naming are replaced. For example, ':' is replaced by a '\\_'. So, constructing ids from the names shouldn't be hard and the ids should be used in rate strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the usage of the createNewReaction is described as follows. For a simpleModel object, use - \n",
    "`self.createNewReaction(reaction_id, reaction_string, reaction_rate_string, reaction_fast_bool = False, reaction_isConstant_bool = False)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two arguments are boolean values to set the reaction's fast and isConstant attributes. The fast attribute is set to False by default and hence is optional. The isConstant attribute is to denote whether the species involved in the reaction are constant or not. The default value is False. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Reaction libsbml object is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative (longer) method to create reactions \n",
    "An alternate way to create the reactions is available which provides access to all the individual components of a reaction. This may be helpful when creating reactions with peculiar properties. A new reaction is created in the libsbml Model object and a SimpleReaction class object is created so that it can be used to create the reactants, products, rate etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usage - \n",

    "* Set the reversible and fast attributes of the reaction (they are mandatory in SBML). `r.setReversible(bool)` , `r.setFast(bool)`.\n",
    "* Use methods of the SimpleReaction class to create the reactants, products and rate of the reaction. `r_obj.createNewReactant(species_id, isConstant, stoichiometry)`. Similarly, `r_obj.createNewProduct(species_id, isConstant, stoichiometry)`. Finally, create the rate for the reaction using a formula string which uses the species and parameter ids. `ast_node = r_obj.createMath(formulaString)`, set the ast_node to the reaction rate. `r_obj.createRate(ast_node)`\n",
